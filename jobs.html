  <h2>Take a look at the positions we hire for below.</h2>
    <dt>
        <strong>Baristas</strong><br><br>
        <dd>Baristas are an important part of our customers' day, and experts in
        handcrafting deliciously perfect beverages. Connecting and creating the
        moments that make a difference in each person's day.</dd><br>
      <strong>Shift Supervisors</strong><br><br>
        <dd>Shift Supervisors help direct work on the floor. Running a shift,
        leading a team, and making decisions that impact store operation. A great
        way to develop leadership skills and expanded responsibility. They also
        help create great experiences for partners and customers alike.</dd><br>
      <strong>Store Managers</strong><br><br>
        <dd>Store Managers run their own million-dollar business--from managing
        their store's operations to responsibility for financial results. This
        is not a back room management position. It's being on the front line,
        connecting with customers and partners. It's the opportunity to develop
        your own team, hiring and welcoming new partners and future leaders for
        your store.</dd><br><br>
